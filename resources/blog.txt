Life would be a whole lot easier if someone would just Venmo us $1 million,
but unfortunately the chance of that happening is, well, probably zero.
(Venmo doesn’t allow transactions that large anyway.)
But even though our chances of becoming a millionaire are slim,
we can still manage our money like one. No, we’re not going to tell you
how to buy hundreds of shares of Apple stock. Or how to pick out the perfect yacht.
These are simple money moves any normal, non-millionaire
person can make today.
Each tip can get you closer to achieving your big goals.
